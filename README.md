# Spring Boot CRUD API with MongoDB

## üìù Description

This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built with **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**. It provides user management and product management functionalities, adhering to RESTful principles. The application includes token-based authentication and role-based authorization to secure the APIs.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a RESTful API for managing users and products.
- Implement token-based authentication and role-based authorization.
- Ensure the API is secure, scalable, and adheres to best practices.
- Handle errors gracefully and avoid returning 5XX errors.
- Implement security measures such as password hashing, input validation, and HTTPS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher.
- **MongoDB** installed and running.
- **Maven** for dependency management.
- **Postman** or any API testing tool.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://learn.zone01dakar.sn/git/pba/lets-play/.git
   cd lets-play
2. **Configure MongoDB**:
   - Update the MongoDB connection settings in `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/user_product_db
     ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
5. **Access the API**:
   - The API will be available at `https://localhost:8443`.
   - You can interact with the API using tools like **Postman**, **cURL**, or any HTTP client.
   - Make sure your MongoDB server is running, as the application depends on it for data storage.
